# Battle City 

## Problem Situation

The task is to create from scratch a fully working game, 
similar to another very known game "Battle City".  
Necessary features:
* At least 4 types of tanks; They probably will be:
    + Casual
    + Fast
    + Fat (it's like tank-tank :) )
    + Strong
* At least 5 types of obstacles; They probably will be:
    + Breakable:
        + Wooden wall
        + Ice wall 
        + Stone wall (?)
    + Unbreakable:
        + Brick wall
    + Maybe special sort of cell:
        + Bushes
* At least 3 types of spawning buffs; They probably will be:
    + Immortality for some time
    + Additional health
    + Increasing shooting speed
